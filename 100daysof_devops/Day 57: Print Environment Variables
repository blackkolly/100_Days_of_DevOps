The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. 
There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.


Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.

Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

Create three environment variables:

a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to

b. COMPANY and its value should be Nautilus

c. GROUP and its value should be Industries

Use command ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"'] (please use this exact command), 
also set its restartPolicy policy to Never to avoid crash loop back.

You can check the output using kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting command.



Pod YAML Definitio

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-envars-greeting
spec:
  containers:
    - name: print-env-container
      image: bash
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"']
      env:
        - name: GREETING
          value: "Welcome to"
        - name: COMPANY
          value: "Nautilus"
        - name: GROUP
          value: "Industries"
  restartPolicy: Never


1. Create the YAML file:

   vi print-envars-greeting.yaml
  

   (Paste the above content and save it.)

2. Apply it to your cluster:

   kubectl apply -f print-envars-greeting.yaml

3. Check pod status:
   kubectl get pods

4. Once itâ€™s completed (`STATUS` shows `Completed`), view the logs:

   kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting
 
Expected Output
Welcome to Nautilus Industries

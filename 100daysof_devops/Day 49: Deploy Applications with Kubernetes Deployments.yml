The Nautilus DevOps team is delving into Kubernetes for app management. One team member needs to create a deployment following these details:


Create a deployment named nginx to deploy the application nginx using the image nginx:latest (ensure to specify the tag)

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.


Option 1 — Using `kubectl create deployment

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:latest
Explanation:

nginx` → Name of the deployment.
image=nginx:latest` → Uses the `nginx:latest` image.

This will create a Deployment with 1 replica by default.

Option 2 — Using a YAML manifest (recommended for reproducibility)

Create a file `/tmp/nginx-deployment.yaml`:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest


Apply it:

kubectl apply -f /tmp/nginx-deployment.yaml


Step 3 — Verify the deployment

kubectl get deployments


Expected output:


NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx   1/1     1            1           10s


And check pods:


kubectl get pods -l app=nginx

An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. 
The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image nginx:1.17 with the latest updates.

Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the nginx:1.17 image. The deployment is named nginx-deployment.
Ensure all pods are operational post-update.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster




 Step 1: Check the current deployment

kubectl get deployments

Step 2: Perform the rolling update


kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.17

Explanation:

nginx-deployment` → deployment name
nginx` → container name within the deployment (use `kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment` if unsure)
nginx:1.17` → new image

Step 3: Monitor the rollout

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

Wait until it shows:

deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out

 Step 4: Verify pods

kubectl get pods -o wide


To confirm the image:

kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment | grep Image:

Expected output:

Image: nginx:1.17


Step 5: (Optional) Check rollout history

kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter:


1.	Install the required SELinux packages.
2.	Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.
3.	No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.
4.	Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.



1. Connect to App Server 3
ssh banner@stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
Password: BigGr33n

2. Install SELinux packages
Enter command cat /etc/os-release to check the OS
sudo yum install -y policycoreutils selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted


3. Permanently disable SELinux
Edit the SELinux configuration file:
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
Change the line:
SELINUX=enforcing
to:
SELINUX=disabled
Save and exit.

4. Confirm planned state (no reboot needed now)
Since you donâ€™t want to reboot right now, just confirm the config is updated:
grep ^SELINUX= /etc/selinux/config
Expected output:
SELINUX=disabled
